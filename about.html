        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>Our project aims to revolutionize bathymetric surveying by utilizing advanced multispectral and LiDAR drone technology. By integrating these technologies with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we provide a more efficient, accurate, and versatile solution for mapping underwater topography. This innovative approach has significant applications in environmental monitoring, marine management, infrastructure development, and disaster response, offering enhanced data collection and analysis capabilities over traditional methods.</p>
