        <h2>Project Idea: Bathymetric Survey Using Multispectral and LiDAR Drones</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The project aims to revolutionize the field of bathymetric surveying by leveraging advanced multispectral and LiDAR drone technology. Bathymetric surveys involve measuring the depth and mapping the underwater topography of water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans. Traditionally, these surveys have been conducted using sonar systems mounted on boats, which can be time-consuming, costly, and limited in accessibility. By integrating multispectral imaging and LiDAR technology with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this project seeks to provide a more efficient, accurate, and versatile solution for bathymetric data collection.</p>
